In the 2000s, Depp became one of the most commercially successful film stars by playing Captain Jack Sparrow in the Walt Disney swashbuckler film series Pirates of the Caribbean (2003–2017). He also received acclaim for Chocolat (2000), Finding Neverland (2004) and Public Enemies (2009), and continued his commercially successful collaboration with Burton with the films Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Corpse Bride (2005), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), and Alice in Wonderland (2010).

In 2012, Depp was one of the world's biggest film stars,[1][2] and was listed by the Guinness World Records as the world's highest-paid actor, with earnings of US$75 million in a year.[3] During the 2010s, Depp began producing films through his company Infinitum Nihil.

Their divorce drew media attention, as both alleged abuse against each other and both engaged in highly publicized defamation cases.
